We propose that Hats contributors use [Quests](https://quests.com/) as the primary tool for tracking and recognizing contributions to Hats Protocol. This is because unlike Govrn, Quests enables the permissionless recording of contributions featuring multiple contributors, which can then be linked to other Quests, including the [Hats Protocol Season 0 Quest](https://quests.com/q/01H3G1M72VRZP0DXW7ZPHR32G5) (there will be a new general Hats Protocol Quest created for each Season). 

While Quests is our recommended approach, we still invite contributors to use [Govrn](https://govrn.app/) for individual contributions if they'd prefer, especially if they don't want to link their phone number to Quests (this is the only way to log in for now) or if they'd like to record smaller pieces of work within a given Quest project. There is a Hats Protocol organization on Govrn [found here](https://govrn.app/#/dao/165).

Once you have completed your contribution, please add it to the Hats Contribution Database [using this submission form](https://hatsprotocol.typeform.com/to/AaMVILg8).

## Here's how we suggest contributors use Quests to record their contributions:

 1. **Assess necessity of creating a Quest:** We recommend contributors create a Quest for contributions _that fall outside the scope_ of a compensated Haberdasher Labs role Hat.

 2. **Scope the Quest:** Each Quest represents a particular project or period of work, culminating in a deliverable or outcome. Consider bundling multiple smaller milestones into a larger Quest that has some clear deliverable or point of closure at the end.

 3. **Open the Quest:** Start by opening a quest when you are working on a project or scope of work, and add all contributors to that Quest. You can also optionally use the Quest to track documents related to the work. 

 4. **Add all relevant contributors**

 5. **Complete a Coordinape circle among the Quest's contributors** to distribute reputation points based on the degree to which each person contributed to a successful outcome

 6. **Add the resulting GIVE distribution percentages to the Quest description** 

 7. (optional but encouraged): **Set up an 0xSplit for the contributions using the GIVE allocations**, and add the resulting 0xSplit address to the Quest description

 8. **Mint the Quest NFT** 

 9. **Link the Quest to the Hats Protocol Season N Quest** (choose the current Season - we are currently in [Season 0](https://quests.com/q/01H3G1M72VRZP0DXW7ZPHR32G5)), by selecting the "Link it to this one" link at the bottom of the Hats Protocol Quest. The Haberdasher Labs team will then verify the link, attesting to the contribution.

10. **Add the Quest to the Hats Contributions Database [using this submission form](https://hatsprotocol.typeform.com/to/AaMVILg8)**

By adding the completed Quests to the Hats Contributions Database they will be pulled into a Hats contribution board visible to the full community and shared in the Community Telegram Channel, which the community can then add emoji reactions to to signify value. The Season’s Quest NFTs will also be shared for consideration prior to any intersubjective reputation tracking Coordinape circles among Hats contributors.

**As a result, attestation comes in two forms:** through a verified link between the contribution Quest and the relevant Hats Protocol Season Quest, and through community reactions when the Quest is added to the Hats Contributions Database
