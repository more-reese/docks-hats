Hats are _roles_.

In one sense, this is very obvious, but I personally think about roles very differently than how the term is typically used (less so in this community, but definitely in many other contexts). 

## What is a role?

A Role is an incredibly rich bundle of tightly related concepts: 

- **responsibility**: what is the role's purpose? what does it exist to accomplish?

- **authority**: what does it need to accomplish those goals?

  - access to or control over specific tools and resources

  - permissions

  - rough general authority

- **accountability**: who or what is it accountable to?

- **clarity & context**: where does it fit into the larger picture? how does it relate to other roles?

- **incentives & compensation**: what motivates an agent (person, group, collective, etc) to fulfill the role's responsibility

A key point is that all of these components are extremely abstract and fractal. A role can be as tiny as a single hour's task or as large as a multi-decade project.

People in organizations don't just wear a few hats, they wear hundreds. Today, its woefully inefficient to attempt to even identify, let alone track, all of these roles. Instead, we default to single titles and pretend they are our roles. They are not. We can do better.

The more atomic we can make roles, they more effectively organizations and their members will be able to collectively manage the reality of fluid work. If we conceptualize work in big frozen icebergs of titles, its not very fluid. But if we can interact with it as water molecules, a whole new realm of possibilities opens up.

## Role Evolution and Capture-Resistance

Another exciting possibility is related to how roles evolve, in particular with respect to who/what is holding them. The more we can atomize roles, the easier it is to find ways to automate the automatable and -- most importantly -- minimize trust requirements and bolster resistance to capture. Eligibility Modules, Toggle Modules, and Hatter contracts being the primary tools. 

Imagine the same role being passed...

- from a person to an autonomous smart contract

- from a person to a multisig to a DAO

- from a person to an AI constrained by smart contract logic
