**Bounty: x500 DAI**

# Overview

Hats Protocol needs a dashboard with some high level analytics. This is a bounty for a simple Dune Analytics dashboard.

# Desired Properties

We're looking for the following metrics...

- Total number of top hats

- Total number of hats created

- Total number of hat wearers ("hats on heads") â€” mainnets only

...broken out by the following dimensions / categories

- Total (if possible across networks)

- Each of the networks we support

  - Mainnets: Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, Gnosis Chain

  - Testnets: Goerli

- _\[stretch goal\] By month_

  - _eg "New monthly top hats minted", "new monthly hats created", etc_

## Other Notes

- We'll add you to our Dune team

- Hats.sol has been added to Dune as a "decoded project" for all relevant networks

# What you can expect from the Hats Protocol team

- We will work with you to understand how Hats Protocol works and its data model

- We will be available for questions and support throughout the project

- If/when we see you irl, you'll get a Hats hat! ðŸ§¢
