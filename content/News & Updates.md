Staying up-to-date on Hats Protocol:

**Hats Protocol Apps:**

- **[v1.3 of the Hats app](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz) is now live!** This update includes:

  - **Guild v0 integration** - you can now add a Guild to the details field of a Top Hat to create a link to the Hats Tree. If you do this, any Hat in the tree will have relevant Guild roles show up under their respective authorities tab.

  - **Batch mint** - mint as many Hats as you’d like in one go, directly from the app, including CSV upload!

  - **More ENS** - you can now use ENS in forms to easily add wearers and contracts

  - **Expand / collapse in the visualization** - each Hat node / level can now be manipualted so you can see the levels of your Hats Tree with better clarity

- **[Sobol Hats Composer](https://sobol.io/d/labs/hats_composer)** 🧙 is now live! Batch create and deploy your Hats trees (with Safe visualization coming soon)

**Hats Protocol Integrations:**

- **[HatSignerGate](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac) [beta](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac)** 🔏 is out of audit and is now deployed on Goerli and ready for mainnet 

- **[Hats Voting Vault](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/highcouncil-hats-vault)** ✅, a way to give only authoritized Hat wearers a vote in a voting vault. Makes creative use of the Hats addressable ID system.

**Modules:**

- **[Staking Eligibility](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/staking-eligibility/)** 🥩, a new eligibility module that requires a potential-wearer to stake tokens to be eligible to wear a given Hat. If their stake is slashed or they unstake, they automatically lose their Hat. Particularly useful for giving people authorities that can't be token-gated, and holding them accountable by having them stake for that authority. 

**Partners:**

- **[Grant Ships Game](https://jokerace.xyz/contest/arbitrumone/0xc1AD5102A357049f3e698248731e6A86f0F3a73d)** 🛥 won the Arbitrum Grants Framework Design Contest! Grant Ships Game is an approach to DAO grants designed to continually improve how we allocate capital, created by DAO Masons (@Jordeth @UI369 @boilerrat) and powered by Hats.

- **[Cabin](https://www.cabin.city/profile/361383040224591952)** 🏕 launched its app earlier this week using Hats to power identity and reputation across its network city (see the "role cards" in the profile linked above). It's an awesome example of Hats being used as a composable protocol powering a beautiful, purpose-built app for a DAO. Tip of the hat to @hillisjd and the Cabin team.

**SUBGROUPS**

**[Relationships & Agreements Between Roles](https://t.me/+t9MqSXNGFOg5OGZh)** **[TG subgroup](https://t.me/+t9MqSXNGFOg5OGZh)** 🕸 spun out of a recent deep dive discussion. Interesting convo happening there about how to incorporate a relational component into Hats.
