Hats Templates are a way to get started using Hats quickly! They are designed to introduce just the right amount of structure, role clarity, and authority delegation for a DAO.

Templates are oriented around specific functions, such as workstream membership and facilitation, grants committees, recognized delegate programs, elected stewardship councils, dispute resolution, and more. You can think of Hats Templates as a wide range of "organizational structure legos" that you can easily fork, modify, and use in a DAO. 

Check out our first set of templates below, developed in collaboration with some of the earliest users of Hats Protocol.
