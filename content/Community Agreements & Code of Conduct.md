# **Hats protoDAO Community Agreements**

- **Listen to understand.** Be open to learning and willing to embrace some discomfort in order to learn.

- **Land the plane.** Speak succinctly to provide space for others.

- **Practice self-care.** We value mental and physical well-being. If you notice ways that Hats protoDAO could be a more positive environment for you, we’d love to hear it.

- **Create inclusive spaces.** We recognize the potential of every person to contribute, and seek to advance a paradigm where individual capabilities can be expressed fully in service of collective goals. 

- **Stay open to emergence.** We’re trying things on; it’s OK to change your mind.

- **Maintain confidentiality.** For information shared in any of our non-public channels, take the learnings but do not reveal who made any specific comment without consent.

# **General Principles**

People are free to take actions within the constrained set of authorities designated by their hat. With all actions, hat wearers are expected to:

1. Using the advice process to get input from others who will be affected by an action prior to executing that action, on a spectrum proportional to the significance of the action, and

2. Transparently sharing those actions with others in the appropriate Telegram channel.

For actions that fall out of the scope of your hat, a proposal should be brought to the appropriate hat-wearer for consideration. If in the case there is no relevant hat-wearer, the appropriate communication channel will be used.

# **Code of Conduct**

# **Removal from Hats protoDAO**

Hats protoDAO is not a true DAO as it is not decentralized. In Hats protoDAO, the ultimate authority is held by the Haberdasher Labs team. Over time we aim to decentralize this authority, giving more power to the community to moderate and resolve disputes. However, at this time, permission to participate in Hats protoDAO is provided solely by the Haberdasher Labs team, and the Haberdasher Labs team can choose to remove someone from the Hats protoDAO at any time at their sole discretion.
