**UPDATES**

Today we covered the following developments from the past month:

**[HatSignerGate](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac) [beta](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac)** üîè is out of audit and is now deployed on Goerli and ready for mainnet¬†

**[Hats Voting Vault](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/highcouncil-hats-vault)** ‚úÖ, a way to give only authoritized Hat wearers a vote in a voting vault. Makes creative use of the Hats addressable ID system. Demo starts at 5:30 of the recording.

**[Staking Eligibility](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/staking-eligibility/)** ü•©, a new eligibility module that requires a potential-wearer to stake tokens to be eligible to wear a given Hat. If their stake is slashed or they unstake, they automatically lose their Hat. Particularly useful for giving people authorities that can't be token-gated, and holding them accountable by having them stake for that authority.¬†

**[app.hatsprotocol.xyz](http://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/)** **[v1.2](http://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/)** üå≤ is now live! Huge shout out to @scottrepreneur @vidviidviiid and @gershido for all their work on it. Updates include:

\- Hat names on tree nodes & wearer cards

\- Updated node visualization w/ more info on hover

\- Indicator to show you are the wearer of a specific Hat

\- Top Hats can now be transferred in the app

\- Home page networks filter and infinite scroll

\- Automatic UI updates after user actions

**[Sobol Hats Composer](https://sobol.io/d/labs/hats_composer)** üßô is now live! This is a super legit tool created by @BPetes, @damiansski and the Sobol team to batch create and deploy your Hats trees (with more exciting features coming soon like Safe visualization)

**[Grant Ships Game](https://jokerace.xyz/contest/arbitrumone/0xc1AD5102A357049f3e698248731e6A86f0F3a73d)** üõ• won the Arbitrum Grants Framework Design Contest! Grant Ships Game is an approach to DAO grants designed to continually improve how we allocate capital, created by DAO Masons (@Jordeth @UI369 @boilerrat) and powered by Hats.

**[Cabin](https://www.cabin.city/profile/361383040224591952)** üèï launched its app earlier this week using Hats to power identity and reputation across its network city (see the "role cards" in the profile linked above). It's an awesome example of Hats being used as a composable protocol powering a beautiful, purpose-built app for a DAO. Tip of the hat to @hillisjd and the Cabin team.

**SUBGROUPS**

**[Relationships & Agreements Between Roles](https://t.me/+t9MqSXNGFOg5OGZh)** **[TG subgroup](https://t.me/+t9MqSXNGFOg5OGZh)** üï∏ spun out of a recent deep dive discussion. Interesting convo happening there about how to incorporate a relational component into Hats.
