## **Notes**

**How do roles get defined?**

- Roles often evolve organically at the beginning

  - Even if they're centrally defined, they're often a post-hoc explanation of what's happening organically. It's a chaotic process of people needing things immediately.

  - Roles follow needs

- Governance stewardship teams help set the course for basic structure (e.g. subDAOs); then subDAOs identify the roles they think they will need

  - Would be nice if they could learn from other examples of role structure (e.g., templates), and then adjust according to their needs

    - Example: Roam was difficult to start with because you start with nothing. How can we help people to start from a good starting place, learning from other successful experiments?

**What happens if people don't care about the structure and just jump ahead to do their own thing, separate from the identified roles?**

- Can guard against this by attaching real powers to the roles, and incentivizing the roles

**Process for defining roles:**

- Group exercise to name the roles that are needed

- Then mapping what people are doing to the roles (and seeing what roles are unidentified)

- People proposing roles, including authorities and rewards -- including term limits, how the role could be transferred

**Instigation points: 3 ways in which communities start to discuss and formalize structure**

- The Wise One persona -- the person who feels instability in the system and lack of definition. They lean into defining roles in the system

- Squeeky Wheel -- someone who feels like something is not right or unfair about it, and sense shadow powers emerging

- An attack -- some sort of payroll game, collusion, etc. happens

**Key questions around role definition**

- What aspects of a role will change?

- Why would roles change? What causes changes to a role?

- When are those moments coming up in an organization's lifespan?

**What's included in a role?**

- Responsibilities

- Authorities

- Accountabilities

  - Who or what is the role accountable to?

- Wearers/ role holders

**What communities do -- 2 things:**

- Clarify what is our shared truth

  - Communities have shared records (of which roles are one)

- Define and act on what we want to do with our shared truth

**Ideas to explore further**

- Make authorities and roles extremely granular -- make roles 1-1 with a single authority (e.g., single token gate), which can them be composed together into a single role that's comprised of multiple token gates

  - In this case, wouldn't need to change the token gates -- instead just move the hats around that correspond with that given token gate

- Would it be possible to make hats carry all the information required for a token gate to accept them, without having to configure the token gate to look for that type of token? E.g., the gate would look for a token in a wallet that has verified metadata, without requiring anyone to configure the token gate to do that

- Can we represent DAOs that already exist as hats trees, to build up a repository of organizations that seem to be working? Then dive into why they may be working. E.g., Camp DAO, DAO Hause, Raid Guild, etc.

- Ephemeral hats that are fit for specific purposes

**Questions for the future**

- How granular can we possibly get with respect to powers, responsibilities and authorities?

- How should Hats, in the way that we expose the functionality and guide people to use it, learn from the long history of classical debates and learning about roles and organizations?

- Where does Hats give us opportunities to do things in a new way?

- Who token gates the token gates?
