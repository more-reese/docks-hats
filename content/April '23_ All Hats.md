Thanks to @iamaia8 @gershido @brennanmulligan @more_reese @spengrah @nintynick @dropknowledge @epowell101 @BPetes @scottrepreneur for joining today's town hall!

Today we covered the following developments from the past month:

1\. **[ClaimsHatter](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/claims-hatter)** (3:00 in the recording)- enables DAOs to optionally make hats claimable by eligible wearers

2\. **[Season (time-bound) Toggle](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/season-toggle) **(4:30) - turns hats off by default at the end of a season or period of time

3\. **[HatsWallet](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-wallet) **(5:50 for description & 19:35 for demo)

4\. **[SignerGate](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-zodiac)** (7:10) - grants multisig signing rights to addresses wearing a given Hat; recently completed audit

5\. **Front-end v1.1 demo** (10:10) - coming next week to [app.hatsprotocol.xyz](http://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/), new features include image dropzone, automatic IPFS pinning, custom details field (enabling hat names), ENS, revocation, renounce, and authorities tab (mvp)

As always, let us know if you have any questions, have ideas of how you'd like to contribute, or would like our help getting onboarded with Hats or know of others who might benefit from Hats üôèüß¢
