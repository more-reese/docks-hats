Welcome to the Hats Protocol ecosystem contributions repository! On this page you will find the following information:

- Contribution priorities

- Contribution opportunities

- How to apply for a Hats Grant

- Other forms of funding and recognition for your contributions

# Contribution Priorities

All those who are interested in contributing to the Hats Protocol ecosystem are invited to consider projects that advance one or more of the following goals:

1. **Increasing the adoption of Hats** (more Hats on heads)

2. **Decreasing time-to-wearer** (making Hats easier to use)

3. **Increasing or extending the utility of Hats** (e.g., integrations, modules)

# Contribution Opportunities

The following table details a collection of contribution opportunities that have been flagged as potentially valuable additions to the Hats Protocol ecosystem. Some of these are concrete and specific, while others are novel concepts that have sparked curiosity but not yet been fully formed. However, this is NOT an exhaustive list, and we are eager to hear your creative ideas! 

This table will be continually updated as ideas emerge. 

# Project Grants

Haberdasher Labs (a core contributor to Hats Protocol) is launching the first iteration of the Hats Grants Program in September 2023 aimed at advancing the Hats Protocol ecosystem. This grants program will start small but mighty, with the goal of learning how to facilitate a great grants program that catalyzes new contributions and rewards contributors accordingly. 

**To be considered for a grant, [please complete this grant submission form](https://hatsprotocol.typeform.com/to/pG4mHr4H).**

_More details on timing and selection criteria will be coming soon._

# Funding and Rewards

There are four primary ways that contributions will be recognized and rewarded.

## Grants

If you are selected for a grant from Haberdasher Labs, funding will be provided in USDC on a distribution schedule associated with your grant milestones. Please note that to receive a grant you will have to KYC, and for grants in amounts over $600 you will have to sign a contractor agreement with Haberdasher Labs.

## Retroactive Public Goods Funding

At the conclusion of each season, a predetermined pool of USDC will be distributed to nominated projects that made exceptional contributions to the Hats Protocol Ecosystem. Initially, the Haberdasher Labs team will be making these determinations, but over time this authority will be decentralized with retroactive PGF allocations determined by the community.

_More details on how to nominate a project for retroactive public goods funding will be provided in the Fall of 2023._

## Intersubjective Reputation Tracking

Once a contribution is completed, attested to, and added to the Contributions Database [as outlined here](https://app.charmverse.io/hats-protocol/page-0225506388762724), contributors will have the opportunity to participate in an intersubjective reputation tracking mechanism, receiving reputation points proportional to the value they have created. 

These reputation points can be applied in certain protoDAO mechanisms (such as providing the contributor with influence over the curation of the Hats Awesome List and Would-Be-Awesome-List) and in some cases can convert to governance power of the Hats protoDAO. _More details on how this intersubjective reputation system will work will be provided in the Fall of 2023._
