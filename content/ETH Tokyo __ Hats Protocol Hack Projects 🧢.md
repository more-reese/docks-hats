# About Hats Protocol

[Hats Protocol](https://hatsprotoco.xyz) is the DAO-native way to delegate, revoke, and programmatically manage responsibilities and authorities for individuals and teams. In other words, roles for DAOs.

The protocol is highly modular, which creates a number of opportunities for devs to build apps, tools, and integrations. Check out the [v1.0 docs](https://docs.hatsprotocol.xyz) for more info, and see the [code here](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/hats-protocol/).
